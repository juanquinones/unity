#Juan Quiñones repo de Unity

# Overview

The Unity Container (Unity) is a full featured, extensible dependency injection container. It facilitates building loosely coupled applications and provides developers with the following advantages:

* Simplified object creation, especially for hierarchical object structures and dependencies
* Abstraction of requirements; this allows developers to specify dependencies at run time or in configuration and simplify management of crosscutting concerns
* Increased flexibility by deferring component configuration to the container
* Service location capability; this allows clients to store or cache the container
* Instance and type interception
* Registration by convention

# Installation

Install Unity with the following command:

```
Install-Package Unity
```

Unity 5.x loosely follows Semantic Versioning — minor releases may introduce breaking changes. [Floating version references](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/consume-packages/package-references-in-project-files#floating-versions) should lock in the minor version in addition to the major version:

```
<PackageReference Include="Unity.Container" Version="5.9.*" />
```

## [Documentation](https://unitycontainer.github.io)

# Roadmap

### [v4.0.1](https://github.com/unitycontainer/unity/tree/a370e3cd8c0f9aa5f505e896ef5225f42711d361)

Version 4.x is dead. Loss of original signing certificate made it impossible to release anything compatible with v4.0.1 release. To give original developers a credit only about 60 issues were found during two years in production. To move on and enable further development version v5 has been created.

### [v5.x](https://github.com/unitycontainer/unity/tree/v5.x)

Version 5.x is created as replacement for v4.0.1. Assemblies and namespaces are renamed and refactored but otherwise it is compatible with the original. v5.0.0 release fixes most of the issues found in v4.0.1 and implements several optimizations but the emphasis is on compatibility. Once stabilized, this version will enter LTS status and will be patched and fixed for the next few years. v5 minor releases may contain breaking changes, in preparation for v6. There will be no significant development in this line.

To build v5.x locally please follow these steps:
- `git clone https://github.com/unitycontainer/unity.git`
- `cd unity && git checkout v5.x && git submodule update --init --recursive`
- open `package.sln` in Visual Studio and build.



### [v6.x](https://github.com/unitycontainer/unity/tree/v6.x)

This is where all new development will be done. 
The compatibility would not be a driving factor so better performance and functionality could be achieved. 

To build v6.x locally please follow these steps:
- `git clone https://github.com/unitycontainer/unity.git`
- `cd unity && git checkout v6.x && git submodule update --init --recursive`
- open `package.sln` in Visual Studio and build.
